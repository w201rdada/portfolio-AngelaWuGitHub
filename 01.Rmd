## Problem

For Property and Casualty insurance industry alone, the total cost of insurance fraud is estimated to be more than $40 billion per year, which means insurance fraud costs the average U.S. family between $400 and $700 per year in the form of increased premiums. <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Most insurance companies have trained specialists who are tasked to identify and investigate suspicious claims. But the process currently in place is very manual and time consuming. The specialists have to manually review claim files and make an educated guess whether the claim is legit or fraudulent. Some more data-driven insurance companies have started to build statistical models to better understand the types of claims that are more likely to be fraudulent


## Solution

We should fully utilize the recorded phone calls between claimants and claims adjusters to battle insurance fraud. The recorded phone calls are readily available but haven not been used to identify suspicious claims. Calculate real-time probabilities of fraud => prompt more questions

## Consequences

The claim processing time will be lengthened. An increasing stress will be placed on the claimants who are falsely identified as frauds by the model.
