## Problem

Currently, auto insurers collect "static" information about policyholders and use it to price insurance premiums. This information is usually in two categories: drivers' characteristics (driver's gender, age, etc.) and vehicle's information (make and model, model year, etc.). This type of data is easily available, and can be easily verified, and thus has been used as predictors for insurance losses [1]. However, but lack a strong relationship with occurrence of accident. Accidents are currently reported by the driver sometime after the accident. Sometimes the exact time and location of accidents cannot be recalled or identified. 

## Solution

* Cell phone is widely used and the accelerometer on the phone can be used to monitor the movement of the vehicle, and keep track of driving habit.
* Using cell phone accelerometer data alone to identify accidents could be hard at the beginning since we don't know how data looks like when accidents occur. 
* In order to get a more accurate reading on when accidents happen, we can offer a one-click service to drivers (call policy, call ambulance if necessary, notify the agent, notify toll company if necessary). 
* Benefits: 
  * Better service to the policyholders
  * Automatically notify multiple parties, calm the drivers, help is on the way
  * Get immediate medical help, by sharing the location => reduce medical expenses 
  * Collect accurate accident data (g-force, location, pull relevant traffic information, pull relevant weather information)
* Analyze the driving behavior right before the accidents, weather, traffic, location of accidents
  * Maybe some intersection/road is prone to accidents
  * Maybe weather
  * Maybe driving behavior (speeding, fast turning, reckless driving)
  * Maybe driver was on the phone
* Build a model to better predict the riskiness of policy by comparing the similarity of driving behavior/environment with those of accidents

## Consequences

* Better understand the driving behavior and environmental factors contributing to car accidents
* Not all policyholders are comfortable with insurers collecting driving data, so data could be subject to self-selection bias.
